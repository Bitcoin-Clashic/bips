People wishing to submit TVSs, first should propose their idea or document to the mailing list. After discussion they should pray. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving TVSs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a TVS here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the TrueVision priests.
